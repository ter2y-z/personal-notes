# Preparation

:scissors: We need to cut release (deploy from NP to STAGING) for the repos.

1. Wait for Aimee to finish BVT on NP (Tuesday).

2. Check the Release section for each repo (Tuesday):  
   - UI: https://github.com/anzx/xplore-ui/releases
   - BFF: https://github.com/anzx/xplore-backend/releases
   - Codex: https://github.com/anzx/codex-jmix/releases

3. Ensure an automated PR is created on [xplore-k8s](https://github.com/anzx/xplore-k8s) after each repo publishes a release.
   - [Why I can't see an automated PR on k8s](#why-i-cant-see-an-automated-PR-on-k8s)

4. Approve and merge the automated PRs on xplore-k8s (Tuesday).

5. Check and test the changes on [**STAGING**](https://xplore-staging.service.anz/) to verify features from release notes (Tuesday/Wednesday).

6. Inform Aimee that **STAGING** is ready (Tuesday/Wednesday).

7. Request Aimee to initiate a Change Request (CR) (Tuesday/Wednesday).

8. Obtain the CR number (CHGXXXXX) and Release Notes from Aimee (Tuesday/Wednesday).

# Deployment
Confirm release details with the team/Aimee. Information can typically be found in the release documentation, like the example below:

## üöß Release on xplore-infra

1. At the beginning, ask the whole team to confirm what changes need to be include in the CR. Then confirm all the information with Aimee.

2. Confirm which workflow the PR needs to run. According to Ashitha:

   Examples:
   - [#1781](https://github.com/anzx/xplore-infra/pull/1781): Needs `üé™ CICD (BigQuery)`

   - [#1773](https://github.com/anzx/xplore-infra/pull/1773): Confirm with the team if the comment section lacks information.

3. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/anzx/xplore-infra/actions) and find the related actions which is waiting. For example, for the PR #1781, we should click `üé™ CICD (BigQuery)` on the left handside menu. Then we can find it waiting in the list:

# Frequently Asked Questions
<details>
  <summary id="why-i-cant-see-an-automated-PR-on-k8s"><h2>Why can't I see an automated PR on k8s?</h2></summary>

  The absence of an automated PR on k8s can be caused by different issues, varying case by case. Here's a breakdown:

  - If you notice logs under a failed `create-pr` workflow, such as:
    ```
    ...
    To https://github.com/anzx/xplore-k8s
    ! [rejected]          auto-release-bff-staging -> auto-release-bff-staging (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/anzx/xplore-k8s'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    ...
    ```
    This indicates that there is already a branch named `auto-release-xxx-staging` that previously failed to merge. As a result, the workflow failed to create a new branch with the same name.
